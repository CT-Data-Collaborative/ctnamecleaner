# CTData Collaborative's Connecticut Name Cleaner

Inspired by the [work of TrendCT](https://github.com/trendct/ctnamecleaner),
this repository contains a simple 2-column crosswalk of misspelled town names
and villages in Connecticut and their respective correct town names (there
are 169 of those in the state).

### `ctnamecleaner.head(5)`

```

### Updates & Contributions
We at CTData keep updating this crosswalk as we process more datasets.
Any contributions are welcome.
